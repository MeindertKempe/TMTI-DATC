/*
 * Exercise 1-3 Counting characters
 *
 * Write a method that counts the occurence of each letter in the string using
 * the following header:
 *
 *     void count(const char s[], int counts[]);
 *
 * Where counts is an array of 26 integers, counts[0], counts[1], ..., and
 * counts[25] count the occurence of a,b,â€¦. and z, respectively. Letters are not
 * case-sensitive, i.e. letter A and a are counted the same as a.
 *
 * Write a test program that reds a string, invokes the count method, and
 * displays the non-zero counts. Here is a sample run of the program:
 *
 *     Enter a string: Welcome to New York!
 *     c: 1 times
 *     e: 3 times
 *     k: 1 times
 *     l: 1 times
 *     m: 1 times
 *     n: 1 times
 *     o: 3 times
 *     r: 1 times
 *     t: 1 times
 *     w: 2 times
 *     y: 1 times
